# Employee management app
* This is an Android app that adds, deletes,updates and gets employees using an API, i connected the API to the app using loopj.com. I have also incorporated a search feature

* ApiHelper.kt: Please note that the onSuccess function inside the get member function has been OVERLOADED(research more on the topic)

* GetEmployee.kt: getEmployee() and getSingleEmployee member functions have been added to the GetEmployee class

<!-- TODO
